# Create and Configure a vNet in Azure
This is a lab I built and practiced to strengthen my understanding of Azure networking fundamentals. I created a custom Virtual Network (vNet) and segmented it with subnets to simulate real-world infrastructure scenarios. I configured address spaces, applied encryption for secure traffic flow, and used tags to organize resources by environment and department‚Äîmaking the setup easier to manage and audit.

This lab helped me explore how vNets support scalable, secure communication between Azure services. Every step is documented with screenshots and narration, showing exactly how I approached the design, configuration, and governance of cloud networks.

## üîπ Lab Objectives ‚Äì Azure Virtual Network (vNet)
In this hands-on lab, I practiced building and securing an Azure Virtual Network from the ground up.

‚úÖ Practiced creating a Virtual Network in Azure using the portal interface

‚úÖ Configured custom address spaces and IP ranges to match realistic deployment scenarios

‚úÖ Set up multiple subnets to logically segment resources within the vNet for better control and isolation

‚úÖ Applied encryption settings to secure internal traffic and reinforce network security

‚úÖ Used resource tags to organize the vNet by environment type‚Äîclearly labeling production vs. development

‚úÖ Reviewed and validated all vNet and subnet configurations before deployment to ensure accuracy and alignment with best practices
